  title: Piscina Mirabilis Museum
  shortDescription: Piscina Mirabilis Museum | Bacoli | Italy | Culture | Competition | 2020
  descrption: |
    We reconceive the Piscina Mirabilis as a place for the community, in which customs surrounding water are given a new space of appearance.
    Where once water flowed from Piscina Mirabilis into the town of Bacoli, now, in reverse, the town flows into the reservoir.
    The reservoir is adapted to exhibit artifacts of boat building industry both historical and contemporary, which can be traced from the Roman fleet in Miseno to a contemporary shipyard on the Sorrento coast.
