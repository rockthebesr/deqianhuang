    We reconceive the Piscina Mirabilis as a place for the community, in which customs surrounding water are given a new space of appearance.
    Where once water flowed from Piscina Mirabilis into the town of Bacoli, now, in reverse, the town flows into the reservoir.
    The reservoir is adapted to exhibit artifacts of boat building industry both historical and contemporary, which can be traced from the Roman fleet in Miseno to a contemporary shipyard on the Sorrento coast.

    The ruin of Chateau de Vibrac today is a slice of a long history. It represents a natural process. 
    Every element has their own life cycle, varying from a few seconds to hundreds of years. 
    The project tries to use tree houses to record the lapse of time. The architecture is uniquely connected to natural elements such as plant and water.
    The periodical change of these elements triggers varying dynamic experiences in the space.
