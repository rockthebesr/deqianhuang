    OAID’s proposal focuses on adapting traditional Chinese wood tectonics to contemporary programs while seeking a nuanced balance between the old and new. 
    The proposal also delves into the cultural background of Shennongjia Region, featuring on local elements such as wood scaffolding, bull horns, and upturned eaves.
    The façade consists of a series of wood panels. The semi-transparent panels not only emphasis on the wood structure, but also blur the boundary between the interior and the exterior, filtering the outdoor light.

    We reconceive the Piscina Mirabilis as a place for the community, in which customs surrounding water are given a new space of appearance.
    Where once water flowed from Piscina Mirabilis into the town of Bacoli, now, in reverse, the town flows into the reservoir.
    The reservoir is adapted to exhibit artifacts of boat building industry both historical and contemporary, which can be traced from the Roman fleet in Miseno to a contemporary shipyard on the Sorrento coast.

    The ruin of Chateau de Vibrac today is a slice of a long history. It represents a natural process. 
    Every element has their own life cycle, varying from a few seconds to hundreds of years. 
    The project tries to use tree houses to record the lapse of time. The architecture is uniquely connected to natural elements such as plant and water.
    The periodical change of these elements triggers varying dynamic experiences in the space.

    By strategically identifying food as both a catalyst and opportunity to re-think the housing typology, our project takes cues from the existing programs from the Market Basket currently on site in hope to create a more synergistic experience between living, growing, harvesting, and dining for the Somerville neighborhood.  
    The new proposal is a conjunction of housing and varied programs centered around food production and food consumption. 
    The main interest is to raise food awareness, challenge the norms of mass food production, and celebrate locally grown healthy food.

    The new center for the Ohlone humane society is located at Newark, California. 
    Through multiscale nesting strategies, we explore the structural and phenomenal qualities of a large-scale hub for bird refuge, rehabilitation, and recreation. 
    Phased degradability and resilience will be at the center of this design challenge.
